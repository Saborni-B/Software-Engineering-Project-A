## What is it?
It is a Jupyter notebook pipeline that generates a methane concentration map of your region of interest (ROI) over a period of time. 

## Features
* Average concentration map of a region
* Data filtering to display a certain range of concentrations
* Time series data
  * Individual concentration map images for a particular time
  * A time series GIF animation depiciting the changes of the concentration over time

## To get started
Read through the installation guide to determine your preferred platform to run the pipeline. Afterwards, refer to the user manual to see how its run.

## Known Issues
The maps generated tend to have weird artifacts in its plotting such as line streaks and missing data. The data has been double checked against the official ESA Sentinel-5P database and shows similar artifacts.
